1. Prefix Sum

The Prefix Sum pattern involves creating an auxiliary array that stores the cumulative sum of elements up to each index. This technique is particularly useful for efficiently calculating the sum of elements in any subarray.

Example Problem:

    Range Sum Query - Immutable: LeetCode Problem

2. Merge Intervals

The Merge Intervals pattern deals with overlapping intervals and involves merging them to produce a set of non-overlapping intervals. This pattern is commonly used in scheduling and calendar applications.

Example Problem:

    Merge Intervals: LeetCode Problem

3. Cyclic Sort

The Cyclic Sort pattern is used to sort an array containing elements in a given range with O(n) time complexity and constant space. It's particularly effective when dealing with problems involving missing or duplicate numbers within a specific range.

Example Problem:

    Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array: LeetCode Problem

4. Monotonic Stack

The Monotonic Stack pattern involves using a stack that maintains its elements in a monotonically increasing or decreasing order. This technique is useful for solving problems related to the next greater or smaller element in an array.

Example Problem:

    Daily Temperatures: LeetCode Problem

5. Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. In array problems, this often involves selecting the best immediate option without reconsidering previous choices.

Example Problem:
