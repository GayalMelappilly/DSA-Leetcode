## Introduction

This repository is designed to help you understand and implement data structures and algorithms in three different programming languages: Python, JavaScript, and Rust. Each language has its own directory containing the respective implementations.

## Languages

- **Python**: A versatile and easy-to-learn programming language.
- **JavaScript**: The language of the web, widely used for front-end and back-end development.
- **Rust**: A systems programming language focused on safety and performance.

## Data Structures

Here are some of the data structures implemented in this repository:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

## Algorithms

Here are some of the algorithms implemented in this repository:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, etc.)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or new implementations to add, please feel free to open a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines.
